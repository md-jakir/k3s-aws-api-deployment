# Introduction
This repository contains a simple Python REST API built using the Flask framework. The API includes two endpoints: a GET endpoint returning a "Hello, World!" message and a POST endpoint accepting and returning JSON data. Additionally, the project includes a Dockerfile to containerize the API. The application is deployed in a lightweight K3s cluster. The cluster is configured in the AWS platform using Ansible script. The AWS resources are provisioned using the Terraform. This repository contains the detailed explanation and the necessary codes.
